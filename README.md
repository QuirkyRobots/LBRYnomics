# LBRYnomics
Historical LBRYnomics data.
This is a trimmed down version of the oringinal LBRYnomics site for histoic purposes only, and designed to host via GitHub Pages.
There are plans to build a new version of the site at [Nomics](https://nomics.live/data). But until that is done, if it ever is, this site will serve historical data.

The LBRY RETROnomics site will live [here](https://quirkyrobots.github.io/LBRYnomics/) while being converted. Once done, I'll map the custom domain name to it.
